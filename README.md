Team Dorothy-Albert

Welcome to the README file of Team Dorothy-Albert!

We are a group of trainees participating in the HackBio Genomics Internship, under the guidance of our team manager: Bhavi, and Rajarshi, team leader: Yossra, leader assistants: Simeon and Ahmed.

The members of our team are Rehab, Drake, Simeon, Ahmed, and Yossra.

We have successfully reached STAGE 2. In this stage, we have been asked to implement a pipeline that conducts the following processes: download dataset => Quality Control => Trimming => Genome Mapping => Variant Calling. This pipeline will be applied to an original dataset as well as additional datasets.

The submission should include 3 files:
script.sh: This is your final pipeline.
setup.sh: This file can be used by anyone to install all the tools required for the pipeline to work.
requirement.txt: This file simply lists all the tools you used.

Thank you and let's continue working together towards our goals!

Best regards,
Team Dorothy-Albert
